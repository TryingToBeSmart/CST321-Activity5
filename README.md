# CST321-Activity5
This activity is to practice using bash shell scripts to make decisions, perform loops, and work with files.

### Print files
[printFiles.sh](/printFiles.sh) program uses for loop to iterate through all the elements in the ls list.  Each time a new ls element is selected, it is assigned to the variable i and then printed to console.

### Print names
[printNames.sh](./printNames.sh) program uses a for loop to sort each element from a txt file and then iterate over each element and assign the currently selected item to the variable 'name' and then print that currently selected item.  Also, if the name is 'Mark', then print 'Found Mark'.
